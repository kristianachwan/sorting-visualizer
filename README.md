### Project details 
Using useState to re-render when user wants to regenerate the array, altogether with rendering the new bars 

### Sorting algorithm visualizer procedure
We modify the DOM not the state anymore (since setArray is really vulnerable to infinite loops). 
Array state is modified, yet it is not rerendered; changes displayed is ONLY caused by DOM manipulation
